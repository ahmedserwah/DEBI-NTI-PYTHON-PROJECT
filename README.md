### stringops project
 created a module to implement python functions . 
 there is two files:
    - COOD which is the main file that contain python codes 
    - StringOps which we will use to import the cood.py in 
to import the code in stringops 
*from cood import *any function*

### the first and the the third funtion solved by using REGEX 

### functions ###
-you can use f(s) or fs(s) for a given nonempty string s find a minimum substring t and the maximum number k, such that the entire string s is equal to t repeated k times.
-you can use is_palindrome(s): for checking the string is palinrome or not
you can use solve(a,b): You will be given two strings a and b consisting of lower case letters, but a will have at most one asterix character. The asterix (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase letters. No other character of string a can be replaced. If it is possible to replace the asterix in a to obtain string b, then string b matches the pattern . If the string matches, return true else false.

### this is the finale project for NTI pythion track.
